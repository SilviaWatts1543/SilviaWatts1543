## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a data scientist leveraging the power of Julia and the DataFrames.jl package to perform fast, scalable, and expressive data analysis. This repository contains a collection of projects focused on big data processing, statistical analysis, and machine learning model development, all written with performance and clarity in mind.

Julia combines the speed of low-level languages with the ease of high-level syntax, making it an excellent choice for computational data science. Using DataFrames.jlâ€”Julia's flexible and efficient data manipulation libraryâ€”I handle everything from exploratory data analysis to preprocessing pipelines for machine learning at scale.

Big Data Processing: The projects demonstrate working with large datasets using efficient in-memory operations, lazy evaluation, and multithreading techniques to optimize performance. I also include examples of integrating with CSV.jl, Parquet.jl, and Query.jl for data ingestion and transformation.

Statistical Analysis: This repository includes examples of descriptive and inferential statistical techniques, hypothesis testing, and regression modeling using packages like GLM.jl and StatsBase.jl. These workflows are designed to be reproducible and easily extendable for new datasets or problem domains.

Machine Learning: I showcase the development and evaluation of models using Juliaâ€™s MLJ.jl ecosystem, with a focus on clear feature engineering, model selection, cross-validation, and performance tuning. Each notebook walks through the full machine learning pipeline, from raw data to interpretable results.

This repository is ideal for data scientists, researchers, and developers interested in high-performance analytics and reproducible workflows. Each project includes detailed documentation, sample datasets, and code comments to support learning and collaboration.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contributeâ€”Julia is growing fast, and so is its data science community.
